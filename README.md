Code that will be used for the main keynote at Interactions '14


Project Overview
--------------------

GearPhoneApp - the android application that runs on the phone and connects to the watch, ICWS on CIC and registers a SIP station.  The plantronics code was pulled from the plantronics developer blog at http://developer.plantronics.com/community/pdcblog/blog/2012/11/26/plugging-into-plantronics-headset-sensor-events-via-android

GearSupervisor - the tizen based application that runs on the Samsung Gear 2

OrgspanDirectory - zendesk application to pull Orgspan directory functionality into zendesk

RemoteWatchDisplay - HTML/Javascript app that will show a display of the watch on the main display at the keynote.  The GearPhoneApp sends JSON data to this application the same way it sends the same data to GearSupervisor

ZendeskAgentPortal - the IWP agent portal embedded into a Zendesk application.
